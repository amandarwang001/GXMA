                        A typical group class begins like most martial arts group classes, with a salute to your teacher
                        and your classmates. The instructor then goes from student to student to review their
                        previous material. While students wait for their turn, they train, but hold any questions until
                        their instructor comes to them. During the initial review, students receive corrections and have
                        questions answered. Once old material has been reviewed, students are individually introduced to
                        new material (if appropriate), receive further explanation for the movements they already know,
                        or work on applications with their instructor and/or classmates. Class ends with a salute.

                    <div class="collapsible-body grey darken-2 white-text">
                        During your first class, you'll spend more one-on-one time with your instructor to talk about
                        your previous martial arts experience, what you hope to gain from your lessons, and what your
                        individual needs are. This is when you will discuss your expectations and goals for classes.
                        <br><br>
                        Once those things are covered, you'll join class with your classmates.

                        All students should dress comfortably in weather-appropriate clothes that allow them to
                        exercise.
                        Flat-soled shoes (like Keds or Vans) are recommended; brand doesn't matter. Make sure to bring a
                        water bottle!
                        <br><br>
                        Before class, students should warm up in preparation for exercise. And, ideally, have your
                        previous material memorized, because you can't improve the quality of your movements until you
                        know them by heart.

                        Experience in other martial arts (especially Chinese martial arts) will help you learn the moves
                        faster, because the motions will be more familiar to you. However, experience in other martial
                        arts can sometimes make learning <em>the details</em> of new moves difficult because you are
                        working against old habits.
                        <br><br>
                        In sum, learning new movements is challenging, regardless of experience. So if you're new to
                        Chinese martial arts, don't sweat it! Just come, train, and have fun!

                            <li>A willing friend to work with you at home. They don't have to be martially trained, just
                                willing to help test your structure and have applications tried on them.

                            <li>If you want to continuously improve your art, you MUST come to see Shifu David in person

                                some point. This could be in person in Australia, or when he visits the United States
                                during
                                seminars. You can learn curriculum, forms, and theories through video, but some parts
                                of martial training must be experienced in person. Fortunately, Shifu David is
                                experienced
                                in teaching via video, and you will have plenty to work from after your in-person

                        Some students are uncomfortable with the idea of hitting.
                        <br>
                        Some students just want the health, wellness, and exercise benefits of martial arts.
                        <br>
                        Some students aren't ready <em>yet</em> to experience what applications feel like, but maybe
                        they change their mind after some time training.
                        <br><br>
                        And that's ok. HOWEVER, these are <em>martial</em> arts. If you want to learn the whole system,
                        you're going to need to experience what strikes feel like, both from a giver and a receiver's
                        end.
                        The most important part is to discuss your expectations with your instructor.
